<h4>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?</h4>
<p>The requirement of the app was to make a mobile app that can keep track of warehouse inventory. The need was to have a login database for the user and if they were not on the account they could create one. Once successfully logged in they can view and modify inventory.</p>
<h4>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</h4>
<p> There needed to be a login screen, an inventory screen, and a settings screen. The designs were simple and easy to navigate keeping the user from having to ask for help on where to go and what each object does.</p>
<h4>How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?</h4>
<p>First I read/listen to the user's needs and follow by making sure we are on the same page by confirming objectives. Then, I draw by hand a rough sketch of a wireframe to get an idea of the layout of the UI. I can use these ideas on many futures projects to make successful MVPs and a shorter SDLC. </p>
<h4>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?</h4>
<p>I tested my code, trying to break it to test input validation. This is important to not give the user a bad user experience.</p>
<h4>Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?</h4>
<p>The innovation came from keeping code modular to debug units of code. This kept progressing a lot easier.</p>
<h4>In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?</h4> 
<p>I would have to say was implementing the database handler for each model</p>
